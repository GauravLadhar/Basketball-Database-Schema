# Basketball Database Schema

This project involves designing and implementing a comprehensive basketball Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) using MySQL and phpMyAdmin. This database models a professional basketball environment, capturing key entities such as players, teams, games, player stats, arenas, and positions while allowing for easy future modifiability.

The basketball RDBMS consists of interconnected tables with primary keys, foreign key constraints, lookup tables, and a variety of data types, ensuring data integrity and consistency. The database includes features like cascading updates and deletions, custom default values, and index optimization. Advanced SQL techniques such as triggers, stored procedures, functions, events, and views are incorporated to enhance functionality and usability. The database is implemented in Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF).

The goal of the project is to design and implement a robust basketball database that enables users to efficiently view and analyze player and team performance. By leveraging phpMyAdmin, the database was structured to handle complex relationships between players, teams, games, and statistics, ensuring data integrity and organization. The system provides insightful views and queries, allowing users to extract detailed metrics and make informed decisions regarding team and player management.

Finally, I created an Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) diagram to visually represent the database structure, including tables, relationships, and constraints, ensuring clarity in design and facilitating effective database implementation.
